# ArtistBooker-

Hi,

I've been involved in the music industry for quite some time and I have always noticed a reoccuring issue with communication regarding payment, poor communication from both the artists and venues around things like - When can the venue pay?
                                               - How much was the agreed on payment?
                                               
with ArtistBooker I'm wanting to create a platform where an artist can create a profile that venues can then access in order to booking them, payment amount and time of payment will be set in stone at the time of booking, then once the performance takes place and both parties agree, the funds then become available to withdraw after the agreed up on payment time.
