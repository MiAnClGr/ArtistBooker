# ArtistBooker

ArtistBooker is a dapp I am currently designing to help performing Artists and Venues to better
communicate and negotiate terms and conditions regarding a performance. 

Through ArtistBooker an artist can create a profile, a venue can then request to book an artist, 
doing so creates a smart contract in which terms and conditions can be agreed upon and locked in by both parties.

With ArtistBooker Iâ€™m hoping to solve recurring problems in the music industry such as
- Wait times and vagueness while communicating and negotiating over email
- Wait times and uncertainty around invoicing and payment processing
